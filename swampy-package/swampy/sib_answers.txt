# Text answers from Week 0

# Name: Pat Byrnes (PMByrnes)



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:

from TurtleWorld import * imports everything from the TurtleWorld module

world = TurtleWorld() assigns TurtleWorld to 'world'

bob = Turtle() assigns a Turtle to 'bob'

wait_for_user() tells the program to wait for the user to do something


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:  Arguments are: Turtle, n, and length.  Turtle is a string, n and length are both integers.

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: fd and lt

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: Arguments are: Turtle (string), n (integer), length (integer), angle (float)





Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: pu, fd, lt and pd

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: Would also need to incorporate pu, rt, bk for when the turtle completed a 360-degree arc

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: Postcondition
